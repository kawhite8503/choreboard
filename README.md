Summer is almost over, the activities are winding down, and the kids suddenly have NOTHING to do!

"I'm bored!!" Our response?? "Nonsense!! If you bored, pick up a chore!!!"

The Chore Board is here to add routine and responsibility for the entire household! Set daily chores or add as you need for when the kids get restless!
